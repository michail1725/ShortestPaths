# ShortestPaths

## The introduction project of object-oriented programming, C# specifics and cooperative development. First serious educational project. 
The essence of the program is finding shortest path on user's graph by using Dijkstra's algorithm.
Unfortunately, another service was used to organize cooperative development, so the original history of the project has not been preserved
